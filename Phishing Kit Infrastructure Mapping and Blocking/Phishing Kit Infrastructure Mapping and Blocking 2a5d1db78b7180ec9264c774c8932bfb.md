# Phishing Kit Infrastructure Mapping and Blocking

## **Objectives**

- Investigate a real-world–based phishing campaign targeting **SwiftSpend Financial**.
- Identify compromised users, phishing infrastructure, and adversary indicators.
- Retrieve, analyze, and reverse-engineer the **phishing kit** to expose attacker information.

---

## **Tools Used**

- VM: [https://tryhackme.com/room/snappedphishingline](https://tryhackme.com/room/snappedphishingline)
- **Thunderbird** – to inspect `.eml` files and attachments.
- **grep** – for searching indicators (URLs, attachments, emails) within multiple files.
- **CyberChef** – for URL defanging and decoding.
- **wget / unzip** – to safely download and extract the phishing kit inside the sandbox VM.
- **sha256sum** – to generate the hash of the kit.

# Challenge Scenario

**Disclaimer:**

- Based on real-world occurrences and past analysis, this scenario presents a narrative with invented names, characters, and events.

**Please note:** The phishing kit used in this scenario was retrieved from a real-world phishing campaign. Hence, it is advised that interaction with the phishing artefacts be done only inside the attached VM, as it is an isolated environment.

# An Ordinary Midsummer Day...

As an IT department personnel of SwiftSpend Financial, one of your responsibilities is to support your fellow employees with their technical concerns. While everything seemed ordinary and mundane, this gradually changed when several employees from various departments started reporting an unusual email they had received. Unfortunately, some had already submitted their credentials and could no longer log in.

You now proceeded to investigate what is going on by:

1. Analysing the email samples provided by your colleagues.
2. Analysing the phishing URL(s) by browsing it using Firefox.
3. Retrieving the phishing kit used by the adversary.
4. Using CTI-related tooling to gather more information about the adversary.
5. Analysing the phishing kit to gather more information about the adversary.

## Answer the questions below

### Who is the individual who received an email attachment containing a PDF?

- Open the folder which contains the phishing emails.
    
    ![image.png](image%202.png)
    
    The directory has 5 **.eml** files, and one of these emails contain a **pdf** attachment that I am looking for.  
    
    ![image.png](image%203.png)
    
- I can either open each email with Thunderbird to find if any of these emails contains the pdf attachment, or to save time I can use the following command to find name of attachment and file that contains it.
    
    ```
    grep "\.pdf” *.eml
    ```
    
    ![image.png](image%204.png)
    
- Now that the correct email is identified, open it with Thunderbird.

### What is the redirection URL to the phishing page for the individual Zoe Duncan? (defanged format)

- Locate the email which was send **to** Zoe Duncan:
    
    ```
    grep “Zoe Duncan” *.eml
    ```
    
    ![image.png](image%208.png)

    ![image.png](image%209.png)
    
- Open it with Thunderbird and download the attachment.
    
    ![image.png](image%2010.png)
    
- Now open terminal, and using **grep** I am gonna search for the redirection link.
    
    ```
    grep -i “redirect” Direct\ Credit\ Advice.html
    ```
    
    - I used `-i` because I am not sure about the capitalization.
    - `Direct\ Credit\ Advice.html` is basically referring to the “Direct Credit Advice.html” file.

Answer: `hxxp[://]kennaroads[.]buzz/data/Update365/office365/40e7baa2f826a57fcf04e5202526f8bd/?email=zoe[.]duncan@swiftspend[.]finance&error`

### What is the URL to the .zip archive of the phishing kit? (defanged format)

- I checked the site root at `http://kennaroads.buzz` and noticed it’s a WordPress website.
    
    ![image.png](image%2013.png)
    
    ![image.png](image%2014.png)
    
- Then I removed the URL path which was appended for tricking the user and navigated to the `/data/Update365` path.
    
    ![image.png](image%2015.png)
    
    ![image.png](image%2016.png)
    
    It seems that this website is hosting some files. 
    
- Then from here, I went to the parent directory, to the `/data` path, and found the **.zip** file. This is the leaked phishing kit.
    
    ![image.png](image%2017.png)
    
- Copied the URL and defanged it in Cyberchef.

### What was the email address of the user who submitted their password twice?

- To find this, I viewed it the `log.txt` file directly on the server because it was accessible.

    ```
    wget kennaroads.buzz/data/Update365/log.txt
    ```
    
    ![image.png](image%2026.png)

    ```
    grep -i Email log.txt 
    ```
    
    ![image.png](image%2027.png)

### What was the email address used by the adversary to collect compromised credentials?

- I unzipped the kit (.zip) that I downloaded earlier and extracted it.
    
    ```
    unzip Update365.zip -d Update365
    ```
    
    ![image.png](image%2029.png)
    
- Then I kept going deeper inside the folder until I found the `submit.php` file.
    
    ![image.png](image%2030.png)
    
- I opened that file using `cat` and looked for the `$to` or `$send` variable or `mail()` calls.

Answer: `m3npat@yandex.com`

### The adversary used other email addresses in the obtained phishing kit. What is the email address that ends in "@gmail.com"?

- In the current directory, I searched inside all the files for string `gmail.com`:
    
    ```
    grep gmail.com ./*
    ```
    
    ![image.png](image%2032.png)
    

Answer: `jamestanner2299@gmail.com`

### What is the hidden flag?

![image.png](image%2033.png)

- I tried navigating to the phishing URL.
    
    ![image.png](image%2034.png)
    
- So I navigated to the auto-generated endpoint `/data/update365/office365` and started guessing filenames appropriate for a flag that ends with `.txt`.
    
    ![image.png](image%2035.png)
    
- Guessed `/flag.txt`
    
    ![image.png](image%2036.png)
    
- Now inorder to decode it, I copied the secret key and opened terminal.
    
    ![image.png](image%2037.png)
    
    Then reversed it:

# **Lessons Learned**

- **Email attachments** (even HTML or PDF) can serve as phishing redirectors — always inspect their source before opening.
- Phishing campaigns often use **WordPress-compromised sites** to host payloads or kits.
- **Phishing kits** can contain hardcoded adversary addresses — valuable for attribution and threat intel.
- **Simple OSINT techniques** (grepping for “gmail.com” or `$to`) can uncover operator details quickly.
- Always operate within **isolated VMs or sandboxes** to avoid infection when analyzing live phishing infrastructure.
- Attackers frequently reuse templates and infrastructure — identifying hashes and kits helps build **organizational detection signatures**.
