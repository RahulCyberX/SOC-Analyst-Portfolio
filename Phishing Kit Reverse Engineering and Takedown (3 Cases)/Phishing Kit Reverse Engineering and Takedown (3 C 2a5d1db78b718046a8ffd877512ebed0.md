# Lessons Learned

- Phishing often uses **spoofed sender addresses** and **brand impersonation** (Netflix, Apple, DHL).
- **Header analysis** reveals the **originating IP**, **return-path domain**, and **real sender** behind spoofed names.
- **Shortened URLs** and **redirect chains** obscure malicious destinations — always expand and defang.
- **Attachments (PDF, XLSX)** may contain **embedded scripts or exploits** (e.g., `CVE-2017-11882`).
- Sandbox results show malicious activity via **svchost.exe**, fake updates, or network callbacks.
- Common malicious indicators include:
    - `etekno[.]xyz` (spoofed Netflix email)
    - `2[.]16[.]107[.]24` / `2[.]16[.]107[.]83` (bad IPs from PDF campaign)
    - `biz9holdings[.]com`, `findresults[.]site` (domains from Excel-based exploit).
- Effective phishing defense depends on **rapid IOC extraction**, **automated blocking**, and **continuous user education**.
