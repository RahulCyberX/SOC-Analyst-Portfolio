# [Investigation]

A Sales Executive at Greenholt PLC received an email that he didn't expect to receive from a customer. He claims that the customer never uses generic greetings such as "Good day" and didn't expect any amount of money to be transferred to his account. The email also contains an attachment that he never requested. He forwarded the email to the SOC (Security Operations Center) department for further investigation.

Investigate the email sample to determine if it is legitimate.

# **Lessons Learned**

- **Mismatch between “From” and “Reply-To”** addresses is a key phishing indicator.
- SPF and DMARC checks help verify if the sender’s domain is authorized for mail delivery.
- Attachments with misleading names (like `.PDF__.CAB`) often conceal malicious executables.
- Always validate **file hashes** and **metadata** via VirusTotal before interacting.
- Phishing detection depends on **layered verification** — combining email header analysis, DNS record inspection, and attachment forensics.
- Even professional-looking emails can hide threats — **trust the data, not the design**.
