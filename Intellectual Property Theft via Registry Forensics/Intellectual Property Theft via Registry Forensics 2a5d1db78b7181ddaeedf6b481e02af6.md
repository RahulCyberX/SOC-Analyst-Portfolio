# Intellectual Property Theft via Registry Forensics

# Objectives

- Examine registry hives from **James’s laptop** to determine if he accessed or copied **Jasmine’s secret coffee recipe**.
- Identify evidence of system configuration, user activity, network usage, and file access from registry artifacts.
- Correlate user-level artifacts (NTUSER.DAT, UsrClass.dat) with system-level hives (SYSTEM, SAM, SOFTWARE).

---

# Tools Used

- VM: [https://tryhackme.com/room/registry4n6](https://tryhackme.com/room/registry4n6)
- **Registry Explorer (EZ Tools)** → For loading and parsing `SYSTEM`, `SAM`, `SOFTWARE`, `NTUSER.DAT`, and `UsrClass.dat` hives.
- **Windows Registry Forensics cheat sheet** → For key paths and artifact reference.
- **Artifacts folder** on desktop → Contained exported hives for analysis.

# [Investigation]

### Storyline

I need to examine registry artifacts from **James’s confiscated laptop** to determine whether he copied Jasmine’s secret coffee recipe to his machine.

## Scenario

- Jasmine owns **Coffely** in NYC; the **original recipe** exists only on her work laptop.
- **James (IT)** repaired her laptop last week and is **suspected** of copying the recipe to his machine.
- Forensics found **no obvious traces on disk**, but the security team exported **registry hives** for analysis.
- My job: **parse the registry artifacts** and determine presence (or traces) of the secret files.

## Lab / VM details

- Start the lab VM (Start Machine → split-screen view). If VM not visible, click **Show Split View**.
- Boot time: **3–5 minutes**.
- Desktop contains:
    - **Artifacts** folder → registry hives to examine.
    - **EZ tools** folder → analysis tools (includes Registry Explorer).

## Access / Credentials

- **Username:** `Administrator`
- **Password:** `thm_4n6`

## Notes / approach

- Use **Registry Explorer** or the provided EZ tools to parse hives (expect delay while parsing).
- Focus areas in registry that commonly reveal file/activity traces: **RecentDocs, MUICache, UserAssist, shellbags, MountPoints2, TypedURLs, USB/ConnectedDevices entries**, and any custom app MRU entries.
- Save findings (keys/values/timestamps) and record evidence paths and timestamps for reporting.

## Answer the questions below

**How many files are available in the Artifacts folder on the Desktop?**

Answer: `6`

# Task 2: Windows Registry Forensics

## Overview

The **Windows Registry** acts as a **database** that stores vital information about:

- The **system configuration**
- **User accounts and activities**
- **Processes executed**
- **Files accessed, modified, or deleted**

This makes it a crucial source of evidence in forensic investigations.

---

## Task Setup

In this challenge, I need to **analyze the registry hives** extracted from **James’s machine** (the suspect) to uncover traces of suspicious activity — possibly involving Jasmine’s secret recipe.

### Hive Location

All registry hives are located at:

```
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Artifacts
```

### Tools Location

Required tools (like Registry Explorer, etc.) are available at:

```
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\EZ Tools
```

# Answer the questions below:

## Setup — load the hives into Registry Explorer (do this first)

I want to examine system, user and software artefacts. Loading the hives into Registry Explorer gives me a GUI view of keys/values and timestamps.

Steps I performed

1. Open **Registry Explorer** (run as Administrator if needed).
2. Use **File → Load Hive** and load these files (recommended order):
    
    ![image.png](image%202.png)
    
    - `SYSTEM`
    - `SAM`
    - `SOFTWARE`
    - the user `NTUSER.DAT` for the suspect user (so I can inspect per-user artifacts)
    
    ![image.png](image%203.png)
    
3. If any “dirty hive” or replay transaction dialogs appear, follow the prompt as appropriate (typically **No** to replay logs, **Yes** to load dirty hive).
4. Expand the loaded hives in the left pane to navigate to the paths used below.

    ![image.png](image%2028.png)
    
2. For each GUID, view the `Count` value entries
    
    ![image.png](image%2029.png)
    
3. For each GUID with non-zero count, inspect them to locate `powershell.exe` in the decoded list and read its `Count` value.
    
    ![image.png](image%2030.png)
    

**Answer:** `3`

---

## Q15 - Network monitoring tool executed (UserAssist)

The same UserAssist area often records usage of tools like `wireshark`, `tcpdump`, `netstat`, `procmon`, `nmap` etc.

1. Continue in the `UserAssist` decoded list.

## Q16 - How many seconds was ProtonVPN in focus (UserAssist focus time → convert to seconds)

UserAssist stores focus time (in minutes or 100ns ticks depending on UI). We need to convert to seconds.

1. Still in `NTUSER.DAT\...\Explorer\UserAssist`, locate the row for `ProtonVPN.exe.`
2. Look at the `Focus Time` column value.
    
    ![image.png](image%2032.png)
    
3. Convert that value to seconds:
    - 5m,  43s
    - 5 x 60  = 300s
    - 300s + 43s

**Answer:** `343`

---

## Q17 - Full path from which `everything.exe` was executed (UserAssist / RecentApps / Prefetch)

We need the full executed path to show where the utility was run from.

1. Search the `UserAssist` decoded list for `everything.exe` 
    
    ![image.png](image%2033.png)
    
2. Note the associated “path” text.

**Answer:** `C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads\tools\Everything\Everything.exe`

# Lessons Learned

- **Computer name:** `JAMES` (confirmed source system).
- **User accounts:** 7 total; suspicious user `bdoor` (RID 1013).
- **Administrator account creation:** `2021-03-17 14:58:48`.
- **VPN activity:** `ProtonVPN` first connected at `2022-10-12 19:52:36`.
- **Shared folder path:** `C:\RESTRICTED FILES` indicated possible exfil zone.
- **DHCP IP:** `172.31.2.197`.
- **Accessed secret file:** `secret-recipe.pdf`.
- **Executed enumeration command:** `pnputil /enum-interfaces`.
- **Searched term:** `netcat`.
- **Opened file:** `secret-code.txt`.
- **PowerShell executions:** `3`.
- **Network monitoring tool used:** `Wireshark`.
- **ProtonVPN focus time:** `343 seconds`.
- **Executed from path:** `C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads\tools\Everything\Everything.exe`.

Registry artifacts clearly show user interaction with **secret-recipe.pdf**, use of **VPN**, and **network tools**, supporting suspicion of **data exfiltration** by James.
