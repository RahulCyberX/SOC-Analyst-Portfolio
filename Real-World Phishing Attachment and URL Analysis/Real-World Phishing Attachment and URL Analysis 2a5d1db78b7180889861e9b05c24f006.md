## Tools Used

- VM: [https://tryhackme.com/room/phishingemails2rytmuv](https://tryhackme.com/room/phishingemails2rytmuv)
- **Email clients (Thunderbird, Outlook)** — to open `.eml` samples and inspect headers/body.
- **View Source / Raw Header** options — for full technical metadata (SPF/DKIM/Return-Path).
- **CyberChef** — for decoding Base64 text and deobfuscating embedded HTML or encoded URLs.
- **VirusTotal / Any.Run** — to sandbox malicious attachments or verify domains and hashes.
- **URL Expander tools** — to reveal shortened links (Bit.ly, TinyURL) and confirm redirect targets.
- **WHOIS / ARIN** — to trace IP ownership and domain registration details.

# Task 2: Cancel your PayPal order

**Techniques shown in this email sample**

- Spoofed email address
- URL shortening service
- HTML used to impersonate a legitimate brand (PayPal)

**Quick observations**

![image.png](image.png)

- Recipient address is unusual and **does not match** the Yahoo account — obvious red flag.
- `service@paypal.com` (displayed sender) **does not match** actual sender `gibberish@sultanbogor.com` — spoofing.
- Subject suggests a purchase/transaction to create **urgency** and prompt interaction.

**Email body**

![image.png](image%201.png)

- Designed to look like an official PayPal message (HTML impersonation).
- No attachments.
- Single interactive element: **“Cancel the order”** button/link.
    
    ![image.png](image%202.png)
    

**Hyperlink analysis**

![image.png](image%203.png)

- The link uses a **URL shortener** — dangerous without expanding first.
- When expanded via an online tool, the shortened link **redirects to google.com**.
    
    ![image.png](image%204.png)
    

**Note**

- Tools and methods to expand shortened URLs will be covered later (Phishing Emails 3).

## Answer the questions below

### What phrase does the gibberish sender email start with?

Answer: `noreply`

# Task 3: Track your package

**Techniques shown in this email sample**

- Spoofed email address
- Pixel tracking
- Link manipulation

**Quick observations**

![image.png](image%205.png)

- Email appears to come from a **fake mail distribution center**.
- **Subject line** includes a tracking number to look convincing.
- Link in the **email body matches** the fake tracking theme.

**Important note**

- Yahoo **blocked images** from auto-loading — a security measure to prevent pixel tracking.
- Hovering over the link doesn’t reveal its destination since **Yahoo disabled clickable links** for safety.

**Email hyperlink analysis**

![image.png](image%206.png)

- The source code shows an image named **Tracking.png**, which is actually a **tracking pixel**.
- Tracking pixels secretly **send data back to the spammer’s server** (e.g., confirming if the user opened the email).

**Conclusion**

- Yahoo blocked the images because **tracking pixels are commonly used by spammers**.
- The hyperlink points to a **shady, suspicious domain**, likely related to **malware distribution**.

## Answer the questions below

### What is the root domain for each URL? Defang the URL.

Answer: `devret[.]xyz`

# Lessons Learned

- **Spoofing and impersonation** remain the most common phishing tactics — attackers mimic brands like PayPal, Apple, Netflix, and DHL.
- **URL shorteners** hide real destinations; expanding them safely often exposes malicious redirect chains.
- **HTML-based emails** use fake layouts, logos, and login prompts to harvest credentials.
- **Pixel tracking** confirms active victims by recording email opens.
- **Urgency and fear tactics** (“Account Suspended”, “Payment Failed”) pressure victims into acting quickly.
- **Attachments** disguised as invoices or documents often carry **macros or hidden executables** (`.dot`, `.xls`, `.pdf`).
- **BCC and mismatched sender fields** are red flags in mass phishing campaigns.
- Analysts must **cross-verify sender authenticity**, **decode encoded strings**, and **defang links** before further examination.
- Continuous **user awareness training** is crucial—technical defenses alone cannot prevent human error.
