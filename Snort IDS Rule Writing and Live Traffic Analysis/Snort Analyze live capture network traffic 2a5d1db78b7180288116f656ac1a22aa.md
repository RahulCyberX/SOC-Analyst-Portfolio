# Snort: Analyze live capture network traffic

## Objectives

- Practice creating **custom Snort IDS rules** and replaying **.pcap** traffic.
- Detect and validate traffic for **HTTP (80/tcp)**, **FTP (21/tcp)**, and **file signatures** (PNG/GIF), plus **torrent metafiles**.
- Enrich alerts by extracting **session/host details** (IPs, ports, TTL, SEQ/ACK) and **application artifacts** (service banners, file headers, encodings).
- Build specialty rules for **failed/successful FTP auth**, **GIF/PNG magic**, **torrent indicators**, **IPC$ keyword**, **payload sizes**, and **base64 beaconing**.

## Tools Used

- **Snort** (custom rules, offline pcap analysis: `r`, logging: `l`, full alerts: `A full`)
- **nano** (rule editing), **strings/grep/less** (log triage), **CyberChef / base64decode** (decoding)
- Terminal basics (`rm` for log resets, filters on `snort.log.*`)

# Investigation

This project is all about practicing Snort by writing custom IDS rules and analyzing `.pcap` traffic captures. 

## Writing IDS Rules (HTTP)

I open the folder which has a captured traffic, and then i make a rules file called local.rules which i can use as config when reading the example traffic capture. 

I open the local.rules file using `nano local.rules` and write this code so that I can detect all TCP packets from or to port 80:

![image.png](image.png)

But we can do this in a single line so let’s do this instead:

![image.png](image%201.png)

After that I run this command to run snort for analyzing this captured traffic packet and use my filter

![image.png](image%202.png)

- `c local.rules` → use my rules file
- `A full` → print full alert output
- `l .` → log to current directory
- `r mx-3.pcap` → read packets from the capture file

Once the analysis is done I can clearly see the number of packets it detected:

![image.png](image%203.png)

So, the total number of detected packet is = 60. 

To analyze a specific packet X, where X = 63 (for example), we need to filter the traffic of packet 63 only in our log that we got after analyszing this traffic packet.

![image.png](image%204.png)

![image.png](image%205.png)

After the analysis we can easily see these details as well:

![image.png](image%206.png)

- Source address: `145.254.160.237`, source port `3371`
- Destination address: `216.239.59.99`, source port `80`
- TTL of packet 63: `128`
- SEQ number: `0x36C21E28`
- ACK number: `0x2E6B5384`

## Writing IDS Rules (FTP)

For this i am gonna analyze a different traffic packet and detect “all TCP port 21” traffic. 

![image.png](image%207.png)

And now I am gonna run snort for analyze this pcap.

![image.png](image%208.png)

![image.png](image%209.png)

Let’s read it’s log file to find out the FTP service name, by using the `strings` command, which can be combined with `grep` too. 

![image.png](image%2010.png)

Service name = Microsoft FTP Service.

Now i am gonna do some interesting detentions using the status codes. 

### Rule to detect Failed FTP logins:

First i am gonna remove previous logs using `sudo rm -f snort.log.*` and then use the nano text editor to add the following rule:

![image.png](image%2011.png)

![image.png](image%2012.png)

Failed Login attempts = **41**

### Rule to detect Successful FTP logins:

![image.png](image%2013.png)

![image.png](image%2014.png)

Successful Logins = 1

### Rule to detect FTP login attempts with Valid username but no/bad password:

```jsx
alert tcp any 21 -> any any (msg:"FTP login no pass";content:"331";sid:1000007;rev:1;)
```

### Rule to detect FTP login attempts with “Administrator” username but no/bad password:

```jsx
alert tcp any 21 -> any any (msg:"FTP admin no pass";content:"331";content:"Administrator";sid:1000008;rev:1;)
```

Status code: 

- `530` (Not logged in)
- `230` ****(User logged in, proceed)
- `331`  (Username okay, need password)

## Writing IDS Rules (PNG/GIF)

Here I detect image files using **magic numbers** (file signatures).

PNG files start with hex: `89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A`

GIF magic hex: 

- `47 49 46 38 39 61` (`GIF89a`) or
- `47 49 46 38 37 61` (`GIF87a`).

![image.png](d1ae99f3-2b11-438b-9665-557ffe1b6271.png)

Then run:

```jsx
sudo snort -r ftp-png-gif.pcap -c local.rules -l .
```

![image.png](image%2015.png)

There is one PNG file, lets find our the software name embedded in it:

```jsx
sudo strings snort.log.1757949848 | less
```

![image.png](image%2016.png)

Now I am gonna write rule to detect the GIF file in the given pcap and identify the image format it’s embedded in by investigating the logs. 

GIF magic hex: `47 49 46 38 39 61` (`GIF89a`) or `47 49 46 38 37 61` (`GIF87a`). 

It’s possible to just match prefix `|47 49 46 38|` to match either, then during investigation I can confirm the format easily. 

![image.png](image%2017.png)

Let’s run snort:

```jsx
 sudo snort -r ftp-png-gif.pcap -c local.rules -l . 
```

![image.png](image%2018.png)

As I can see, there’s 4 instances of a GIF image. To find their format I am gonna investigate the log file and use a `grep` command as well to search for the keyword “GIF” to see 

![image.png](image%2019.png)

This confirms the format of GIF are: **GIF89a.**

## Writing IDS Rules (Torrent Metafile)

I can write a simple run to detect any torrent meta file by adding `.torrent` in the content section of the tcp alert rule. 

1. **Rule**:
    
    ```
    alert tcp any any <> any any (msg:".torrent file detected"; content:"torrent"; sid:1000000000009; rev:1;)
    ```
    
2. Run:

```jsx
sudo snort -r torrent.pcap -c local.rules -l .
sudo strings snort.log.<timestamp> | less
```

In the log file, we can easily find more info regarding the torrent, such as **torrent app name, MIME type, and hostname.**

## Miscellaneous Rules

[Source](https://www.jalblas.com/blog/thm-snort-challenge-the-basics-walkthrough/#task-7-using-external-rules-ms-17-010) for the screenshots below, as I forgot to take my own screenshots when I was doing it. 

1. A new rule to detect payloads containing the "\IPC$" keyword:

```jsx
alert tcp any any <> any any (msg:"Keyword found"; content:"\\IPC$"; sid:1000000000010; rev:1;)
```

(special char `\` must be escaped or hex)

OR

```jsx
alert tcp any any -> any any (msg: "Exploit Detected!"; content: "IPC$"; sid:1000001; rev: 1;)
```

1. To see how many rules were triggered:

Just below the alarm info I can see that there’s an another section called *Limits*. Under this section there are the number of events. This is equal to the number of triggered rules.

![image.png](image%2020.png)

By scrolling further below I can find the info on the filtered events, such as **sids**

![image.png](image%2021.png)

1. New rule to detect packet payloads between A and B bytes, for example between **770 and 855** bytes:

There are even examples, so the rule value would be dsize:770<>855;.

All together this will look like:

```jsx
alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"Size between 770 and 855 bytes detected"; dsize:770<>855; sid:1000001; rev:1;)
```

1. A way to find name of the used encoding algorithm:

`snort -r snort.log.<timestamp> -dev`

![image.png](image%2022.png)

1. A way to find the encoded command:

The base64 encoded command is found right after Base64/, still in the same packet:

![image.png](image%2023.png)

To decode this encoded message, for conveince I just copied the string and pasted it in [https://www.base64decode.org/](https://www.base64decode.org/), the output:

![image.png](image%2024.png)

### Lessons Learned

- **HTTP rule (port 80, both directions):**
    
    `alert tcp any any <> any 80 (msg:"HTTP any-80"; sid:1000001; rev:1;)`
    
    → Replayed `mx-3.pcap` produced **60 hits**; drilling logs surfaced per-packet **src/dst, ports, TTL, SEQ/ACK**.
    
- **FTP detection & auth outcomes (21/tcp):**
    - Service banner extraction via `strings` confirmed **Microsoft FTP Service**.
    - **Failures (530):** `alert tcp any any -> any 21 (msg:"FTP login failed"; content:"530"; sid:1000002; rev:1;)` → **41** events.
    - **Success (230):** `alert tcp any any -> any 21 (msg:"FTP login success"; content:"230"; sid:1000003; rev:1;)` → **1** event.
    - **User OK, need pass (331):** general and **Administrator**specific variants using dual `content`.
- **File-type fingerprinting with magic bytes:**
    - **PNG:** `|89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A|` → one hit; `strings` exposed embedded **software tag**.
    - **GIF (either 87a/89a):** prefix `|47 49 46 38|` → **4** hits; logs showed **GIF89a**.
    - Pattern: constrain with **flow/file_data** (if using newer Snort) to reduce false positives.
- **Torrent metafile indicator:**
    
    `alert tcp any any <> any any (msg:".torrent file detected"; content:"torrent"; sid:1000009; rev:1;)`
    
    → Logs yielded **app name, MIME, host** for enrichment.
    
- **SMB/Exploit crumb:**
    
    `alert tcp any any <> any any (msg:"IPC$ seen"; content:"\\IPC$"; sid:1000010; rev:1;)`
    
    (Escape backslashes or use hex.) Useful for spotting **SMB admin share** touches.
    
- **Payload size heuristic:**
    
    `dsize:770<>855;` helped flag suspicious **beacon-sized** blobs:
    
    `alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"770–855B payload"; dsize:770<>855; sid:1000011; rev:1;)`
    
- **Finding encodings & commands in payloads:**
    - `snort -r snort.log.<ts> -dev` surfaces **encoders** (e.g., `Base64/` markers).
    - Extract the blob after `Base64/` and decode (CyberChef / CLI) to recover the **command line**.
- **Workflow tips:**
    - **Reset logs** between runs (`rm -f snort.log.*`) to avoid stale counts.
    - Use **bi-directional operator** `<>` for symmetric protocols (HTTP detections in reply payloads too).
    - Prefer **unique SIDs**, increment **rev** when updating rules.
    - Narrow matches with **offset/depth** or **pcre** to cut noise; pair with **flow:to_server,established** when applicable.
- **Outcome:** Built a small, reusable **Snort playbook** covering service identification, auth state detection, file-type carving by signature, simple data-exfil/encoding clues, and SMB admin-share touches—plus a methodical log-triage routine to validate alerts against packet-level evidence.
